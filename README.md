# My Digital Painting with two.js

# Katie Yeager

- Inspired by code from Colin Manikoth's pen [https://codepen.io/manikoth/pen/gOvXvGZ.js]
- Javascript Libraries: Two.JS [https://two.js.org/]
- I enjoyed this Web 3 project. It kept me intrigued and stimulated throughout. It gave me an eagerness to explore animation a bit more in the near future, might need to look into an animation course.
